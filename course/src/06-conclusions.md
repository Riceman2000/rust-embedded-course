# Conclusions

I hope that this brief walkthrough has been insightful. As I was going through this process I had multiple more experienced embedded developers ask "Will you be covering X topic?" and oftentimes my answer was no. There is much more content to cover if you want to do real work with microcontrollers, here is a brief list of things I would like to cover if there is sufficient interest in the future:
- Using the second core of the RP2040
- Using another peripheral such as the ADC without a BSP
- Exploring abstraction with just a HAL instead of skipping directly to the BSP
- Interfacing with another device such as a I2C temperature sensor

My goal for this project was to briefly bridge the gap between application programming and embedded systems for those that already had a solid foundation in programming. If there are any concepts you feel were not explained or left you confused please reach out to me directly so I can provide more context.

Thanks for reading!
