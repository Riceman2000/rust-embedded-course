This course is intended to be the framework of a project that is simple in nature but is used as a springboard to expand your knowledge of embedded systems. If you are just starting, the first chapter will walk you through getting your environment setup and give you a supply list of parts to order from an online supplier. 


## A few common questions:
### Who is this course for?
  - This course if for people that already have experience programming applications that want an overview of how embedded development works, not necessarlily specifically in Rust.
  - This course is not for people trying to explicitly learn Rust, it is an embedded course that just so happens to use Rust.

### Why Rust?
  - Rust has a unique way of bothering the developer if they don't fully understand what is going on. The compiler does much of the heavy lifting for those hard to find bugs that can be exceedingly difficult to track down on resource limited systems when programming in C.
  - The dependency ecosystem of Rust, while immature compared to C, is amazingly easy to use compared to some of the development environments that hardware manufactures put together. I wanted to be able to step up the ladder of abstraction in a way that not many environments allow for.
  - I like Rust, and I am writing this, so I will use what I want.

### Are we going to be covering X feature?
  - This course is supposed to be as simple as possible so likely not, however, I am more than willing to explore anything that has sufficient interest.

### How should I edit this code?
  - If you are already comfortable with an editor like VIM or VSCode then use that, there is no reason to switch editors for this project.
  - Regardless of editor, however, ensure you are fully set up with the Rust LSP which will be covered in the first chapter.

### How should I follow along the exercises?
  - I suggest that you avoid pulling the repository and just using the code as is, walking through the chapters should give you enough information to program all of the functionality yourself.
  - It is however, totally fine to pull the repository to take advantage of the configuration that has been done for different IDEs and the probe.
  - The completed code along with all the required configuration is in the repo if you get stuck on anything in the course.
